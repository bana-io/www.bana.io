### Enumeration and Job Preferences

Most of what I said below is up for discussion.

* **Rate:** I’m seeking a daily rate of >£580 per day, if it's a contracting role. If it's a permanent role, I'd be looking for >£90k per year. I'm willing to negotiate on this.
* **Start Date:** I’m available to start immediately.
* **Job Type:** I've a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I've been a contractor since then. I would prefer to stick to contracting but I will also consider a permanent position.
* **Location:** If it's a remote role, the office should be based in London in the event that I need to go there. If it's a permanent role, it definitely needs to be in London. I have a British passport and I live between London and Marrakech, Morocco. I'm ideally looking for remote work be in contract or permanent. My preferences are below. **_I prefer option 1_** but we can talk more about this. The biggest issue will be the cost of the flights that's why I'd prefer option one. Basically, my fiancee (soon to be wife) lives in Marrakech, Morocco and I'd like to spend as much time with her as possible. I own a flat in Marrakech and I've got my computer equipment there already setup and running, and I've got 200Mb fibre optic connection, so working and communication shouldn't be an issue.

 1. Eight (8) weeks in Marrakech then one (1) week or two (2) weeks in London.
 2. Four (4) weeks in Marrakech then one (1) week in London.
 3. Three (3) weeks in Marrakech then one week (1) in London.
 4. One (1) month in Marrakech then one (1) month in London.

### Questions

1. Is this fully remote?
2. What is the pay?
3. Is it a contracting role or a permanent one? I don't mind so much as long as it is a remote role.

Kind regards,</br>
