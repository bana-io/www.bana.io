# Intro and Contact Details

Hi and welcome to BanaIO.

I will be writing about Computer Science (CS) and explaining novel algorithms using interactive visualisations. An interview [Princeton Startup TV Interview with Robert Sedgewick](https://youtu.be/7gPuewMWWYI) worth watching 'cause it's Sedgewick and the points mentioned about research papers lacking implementations and them not being printed at conferences which suggests another means of presenting algorithms is required.

If you find any errors on the site, or simply want to say thanks or add something, you can reach me on [b@bana.io](mailto:b@bana.io).

Mohamed Bana
