I have a British passport but I mainly live in Marrakech, Morocco. I can come to London at most once every four weeks.

I've have a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I've been a contractor since then.

I'd like to know:

* Do they allow remote working? I'm only interested in a mainly remote role.
* What is the pay?
* Is it a contracting role or a permanent one? I don't mind so much as long as it is a remote role.

Contact details:

* WhatsApp number: +447960045281
* Morocco Telecom mobile number:+212624846935
* Morocco Telecom house number: +212808526830

Thanks,
Bana
