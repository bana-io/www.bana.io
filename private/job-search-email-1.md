Hi, thanks for getting back to me. I have a few questions.

1. Is this fully remote work?
2. Are you using GCP or AWS? It mentions both in the specification.
3. "Choose your own hardware": What do you mean exactly? Can I use my own machine to develop or am I required to use a company laptop, say?
4. What are the official working hours?
5. I do not think I will accept a salary less than Â£90,000k.
6. What is the expected start date?

My contact number is:

+44-20-7097-4635

I will be reachable all day aside from 13:30 to 14:30.

Thanks,
