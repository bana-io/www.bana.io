Hello,

I'm in the market for a new role.

* https://bana.io
* https://bana.io/resume/
* https://bana.io/resume/cv-download: PDFs of my CV and Cover Letter.

Happy to talk more but I've detailed all I can in my Cover Letter and CV. If you are happy to talk, drop me an email first.

I have a few questions.

1. Is this fully remote work?
2. Are you using GCP or AWS? It mentions both in the specification.
3. "Choose your own hardware": What do you mean exactly? Can I use my own machine to develop or am I required to use a company laptop, say?
4. What are the official working hours?
5. I do not think I will accept a salary less than Â£90,000k.
6. What is the expected start date?

My contact number is:

+44-7960-045-281

Thanks a lot.
