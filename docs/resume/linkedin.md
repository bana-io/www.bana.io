I am available immediately. I went to Marrakech, Morocco on the 4th of January to buy a flat and I stayed until the 22nd of July 2020 mainly due to Morocco closing the borders due to COVID-19.

I am back in London until, hopefully, the 28nd of August. I'll be free shortly after this date. I can talk on UK mobile number, +447960045281.

I have a British passport and I live between London and Marrakech, Morocco. I can come to London at most once every four weeks.

I've a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I've been a contractor since then.

I'd like to know:

1. Is this fully remote?
2. What is the pay?
3. Is it a contracting role or a permanent one? I don't mind so much as long as it is a remote role.

Contact details are below but since I am in Morocco at the moment it's best to reach me on the second number unless you want to send me a message or call me on WhatsApp:

* UK WhatsApp number: +44-7960-045-281
* Morocco Telecom mobile number: +212-624-846-935

Kind regards,
Bana
