A cry for help

Due to recent events, I’ve been job hunting for the past few weeks, needless to say nothings come to fruition as a result of it. With the worry of not being able to pay my bills, I need to get something sorted.

I am looking for someone to hire me imminently.

Thanks to my background from starting my career as a C++ engineer, I have a strong foundational knowledge of Software Engineering, and able to use Kubernetes really well and make the software sing, as well as work well as part of a team and deliver projects on tight deadlines.

But most importantly, what I do bring, is discipline and resilience, something no amount of money can buy, and is highly valued in the workplace.

I’m currently situated in London, United Kingdom, but will be willing to travel for work to some extent.

You may not know me, you may not have anything to offer me, but all I ask is that you share this application, so that it could potentially reach the right people, and that I can at least pay my bills.

I appreciate the time you’ve taken to read this!

Please provide an example or evidence of your exceptional ability. *

https://github.com/kubeshop/kusk-gateway:

Kusk is a Kubernetes API gateway powered by Envoy. The main difference with other API Gateways is that Kusk has native support for OpenAPI.

Modern REST APIs are developed using OpenAPI specification that is then used to generate API documentation, tests, server stubs and clients all from the OpenAPI definition. Kusk enables the use of OpenAPI definitions to configure the Ingress Controller of your Kubernetes clusters.

The commits I made against the repository is available to view at https://github.com/kubeshop/kusk-gateway/commits?author=mbana

I am a British citizen and have a British passport, and of course have right to work in the United Kingdom. I was hoping to work fully remotely from the United Kingdom.

I like that you are using Rust in a lot of your open source projects, this is my main objective for applying.
