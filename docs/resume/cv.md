### Senior Software Engineer, [90POE - Ninety Percent of Everything Limited](https://www.90poe.io/), London, UK - 01/02/2018–20/04/2018

I worked at startup specialising in software that runs on ship on two projects that were heavily Go-based.

#### **`platform-document-storage-service`**:

Document storage and retrieval to be used by others services, so it's a core service. The core of the service was written in Go and exposed using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) and http using [go gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux). Both write and retrieve supported arbitrarily large files which was achieved using gRPC unidirectional streams. The underlying store was MongoDB's [GridsFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/) which I interfaced with using the Go driver [mgo](https://gopkg.in/mgo.v2).

#### **`auditing`**:

The service is structured very similar to the preceding in that the underlying service is exposed using gRPC but the top-level interface is done using [GraphQL](graphql.org). I wrote the GraphQL server in go using [graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go). The underlying store is in Postgres and the library I used to interact with it is [GORM](http://gorm.io/).

**Tech:** Go, Golang, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [go gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), Protocol Buffers, [GORM](http://gorm.io/), MongoDB, [MongoDB GridsFS](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/), [mgo](https://gopkg.in/mgo.v2), [GraphQL](graphql.org), [graphql-go](https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go), Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, NodeJS, Jest, [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/), Postgres.

### Full Stack Software Engineer, [Root Capital LLP](https://www.rootcapital.co.uk), London, UK - 09/10/2017–24/12/2017

I worked as a full stack Node.js software engineer on the [Minds for Life](https://mindsforlife.com/) application, mainly on the forum.

#### Frontend

* `react`, `react-redux`, [react-boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/).
* Single Page Application (SPA) targeting mobile platforms.
* `ES56` using most of the latest ES56 features; `async`, `await`, `classes` etc.
* Serveless and hosted on [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as static assets, with [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) as the CDN.

#### Backend

* NodeJS server written in `ES6`, like the frontend.
* [Koa](http://koajs.com).
* MySQL as the datastore, using the [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/) library.
* Packaged as a set of `docker` containers.

#### CI, Devops and Infrastructure

* Services were packaged as containers. Used `docker` and `docker-compose` to start them.
* Builds managed by [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com) and [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/).

**Tech:** JavaScript, ES6, Node.js, react, react-redux, [react-boilerplate](https://www.reactboilerplate.com/), Webpack, [Koa](http://koajs.com), [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/), Sequel Pro, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com), [Wercker](http://www.wercker.com/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Amazon CloudFront](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)

### Full Stack Software Engineer, [Lloyds Banking Group PLC](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com), London, UK - 20/03/2017–22/05/2017

#### NodeJS - JavaScript

* Loopback for server-side of the code.
* ES5/6-based code base.

#### Monitoring/Devops/Misc

* Splunk and sending logs via (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog>) a LogDrain service available on Bluemix.
* Gerrit for managing code.
CI:
* Jenkins: Configuring, managing and installing.
* Jenkins 2: Same as previous plus writing pipeline scripts.

**Tech:** JavaScript, Node.js, ES5/6-based code base, [LoopBack](https://loopback.io) for server-side of the code, [SysLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog), [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io), [Jenkins 2](https://www.jenkins.io/2.0), [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/), [IBM Bluemix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluemix)

### Senior Front-End Software Engineer, [Synthace Ltd.](https://synthace.com), London, UK - 13/04/2016–04/11/2016

Did a fair amount of architectural UI work:

* JWT-based authentication: Implemented most, if not all, of the authentication related UI features. Polymer didn’t have an authentication module as it’s fairly new requiring me to re-implement this feature.
* API interactions: I introduced Swagger JS and did the conversion from plain XHR to Promises, and ensured API was in-sync with the state of the authentication.
* Updates via the Web Socket for notifications and async task updates: STOMP Over WebSocket.
* Bootstrapped the testing using Web Component Tester.
* Deciding on the build, test and hosting strategy, e.g., hosting our own CDN using Azure.
* Performance: 1) pushed to have HTTP/2 enabled, and prototyped, on our custom server written in Go, 2) implemented lazy-loading of our Web Components which are included using HTML Imports, 3) Significantly improved UI build scripts; went from a somewhat un-deterministic build to one that almost always runs.
* Introduced ES6 to the code-base, and moving to defining Polymer elements using ES6 classes.
* Misc: libraries/utils to ease UI development.

We deploy Docker images to our Kubernetes cluster running in Azure using:

* Docker: Fairly comfortable using this.
* Kubernetes: I've done deployments of dev branches, so I understand the deployment model, navigating the Kubernetes dashboard and crude command line interactions, e.g., port-forwarding of the service the pod is running from the cluster to the local machine.

Added support our language called Antha to Monaco Editor, the editor that powers Visual Studio Code.

Since this is a startup I have done a fair amount of work and I have been given a fair share of responsibility, more so than any of my prior roles.

**Tech:** JavaScript, ES6, [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org), [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org), TypeScript, VSCode, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Go, [Polymer Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester), Git, Swagger.

### Software Engineer, [IG Index Ltd.](https://www.ig.com/uk) London, UK - 09-2014–18/02/2016

#### Price & Indicator Alerts

My main responsibility was handling the UI aspect—setting, configuring, triggering—of the various Alerts we support, from the basic Price Alert to Technical Indicators such as RSI and Moving Average. **Tech New:** Modern UI powered by ES2015 (Babel), Ember.js, Handlebars and Less. The UI was then composed of isolated and reusable Ember components. Runs on a NodeJS server, managed with npm and bower, and version controlled using Git. Integration and unit tests written in Mocha then run using Karma. **Tech Old:** Vanilla JavaScript using an in-house framework when changing the previous UI.

#### Charts

Assisted in the conversion of the Adobe Flex Real Time Charts to an SVG-based version. **Tech:** d3 and tested like above.

#### Deeplinking

A hashed action link, like typical deeplinks, that we send to our Clients which then launches the mobile IG app, or directs them to the app store for the device with the IG app pre-selected. Upon login the action is carried out automatically. I did the bulk of the work with the team lead overseeing it. **Tech:** Java 8, Spring and acceptance tested using Cucumber. Redirecting and launching of the IG app was done using vanilla JavaScript.

### Software Engineer, [ITRS (International Trading Room Software) Group Ltd.](https://www.itrsgroup.com) London, UK - 02-2010–09-2014

#### JavaScript (UI) Software Engineer - 01/2014–09/2014

UI for the next generation of the product which is built around, loosely speaking, a real-time distributed analytics store. The aim is for the old system to stream data to the new system so we can provide all the great visualizations available in the HTML ecosystem, which was not achievable in a reasonable amount of time in Swing.

The code is entirely modularized using RequireJS so we can test each viewmodel without creating a view, we then test the entire UI (end-to-end tests) using WebDriverJS.

Some Java/C coding required to write NodeJS bindings to interact with the store.
We evaluated several frameworks, Angular, Batman and KnockoutJS, by writing prototype applications that connected to our backend for a period of roughly 4-6 months before we chose to settle on Knockout.js.

**Tech:** JavaScript, NodeJS, Node-WebKit, Durandal, KnockoutJS, RequireJS, Git, Jasmine, Protractor (WebDriverJS), Jenkins, Bower, HTML5, CSS, LoopBack.io.

#### Java (UI) Software Engineer - 07/2012–12/2013

Worked with two software engineers and one QA member on a new Swing UI, ACLite, that uses our new  streaming-based API to access Geneos data, for more info. see <https://resources.itrsgroup.com/OpenAccess>. We access data from a fault-tolerant Cluster that is built on a set of distributed nodes. The system we coded against is somewhat similar to the Amazon distributed key/value store, DynamoDB, except with support for streaming, so I am familiar with dealing with distributed systems.

**Tech:** Java, Maven, Swing, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, Vagrant.

#### C++ Software Engineer - 02/2010–06/2012

Spent one year with Run The Business (RTB) team, a team set-up to fix critical bugs that Customers encounter. A very challenging role which requires all-around product knowledge, good debugging skills and being able to liaise with our Support staff in dealing with the Customers. Prior to this I was one of three software engineers working in the Transactions and Latency Monitoring team (part of the backend team) doing core C++. We wrote and maintained the following plug-ins that are part of the Geneos suite:

1. [Geneos FIX plug-in](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.1.0/Netprobe/trading_fix/fix.html): Monitors FIX (protocol) messages.
2. [Feed Latency Monitoring Plug-In](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/market_data_monitoring/feedadapter_ug.html): Monitors feeds and calculates latency of instruments and fields across the monitored feeds.
3. [Latency Monitoring - Message Tracker FIX adapter](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/latency_monitoring/message_tracker/fix_adapter.html): Tracks, generally, FIX messages across several checkpoints.
4. [Market Data Monitor](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/market_data_monitoring/mdm_ug.html): See below. And bespoke plug-ins written for specific firms.

We also maintained several non-finance specific plug-ins. I ported another bespoke plug-in called Price Latency Monitor (provides latency figures for bonds) to MS VC++ when I worked on this team.
Projects:

* I converted the Windows version of the entire product suite from Visual Studio 2005 to 2010.
* I wrote the Market Data Reliability plug-in. This plug-in connects to the Patsystem's Trading API to monitor commodity prices, using their C API, to determine if prices are 'stale'.
* I ported a significant part of our product to Solaris x86-64 (64-bit non-sparc architecture).

**Tech:** C++, STL, Boost, Visual Studio, Linux/Unix, GDB, DBX, Make, Configure, XML, XPath, CPPUnit, [Financial Information eXchange (FIX) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange), [Geneos FIX plug-in](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.1.0/Netprobe/trading_fix/fix.html), [Feed Latency Monitoring Plug-In](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/market_data_monitoring/feedadapter_ug.html), [Latency Monitoring - Message Tracker FIX adapter](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/latency_monitoring/message_tracker/fix_adapter.html), [Market Data Monitor](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.2.0/Netprobe/market_data_monitoring/mdm_ug.html), [Geneos PATS-STATUS Plug-In](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/5.1.0/Netprobe/trading_pats/pats-status.html), [Patsystem's Trading API](www.patsystems.com).
