### Senior Front-End Engineer, [Synthace Ltd.](https://synthace.com), King's Cross, London, UK - 13/04/2016â€“04/11/2016

<!-- Did a fair amount of architectural UI work:

* JWT-based authentication: Implemented most, if not all, of the authentication related UI features. Polymer didnâ€™t have an authentication module as itâ€™s fairly new requiring me to reimplement this feature.
* API interactions: I introduced Swagger JS and did the conversion from plain XHR to Promises, and ensured API was in-sync with the state of the authentication.
* Updates via the Web Socket for notifications and async task updates: STOMP Over WebSocket.
* Bootstrapped the testing using Web Component Tester.
* Deciding on the build, test and hosting strategy, e.g., hosting our own CDN using Azure.
* Performance: 1) pushed to have HTTP/2 enabled, and prototyped, on our custom server written in Go, 2) implemented lazy-loading of our Web Components which are included using HTML Imports, 3) Significantly improved UI build scripts; went from a somewhat un-deterministic build to one that almost always runs.
* Introduced ES6 to the code-base, and moving to defining Polymer elements using ES6 classes.
* Misc: libraries/utils to ease UI development.

We deploy Docker images to our Kubernetes cluster running in Azure using:

* Docker: Fairly comfortable using this.
* Kubernetes: I've done deployments of dev branches, so I understand the deployment model, navigating the Kubernetes dashboard and crude command line interactions, e.g., port-forwarding of the service the pod is running from the cluster to the local machine.

Iâ€™m finishing up on adding support for our language Antha to Monaco Editor, the editor that powers Visual Studio Code.

Since this is a startup I have done a fair amount of work and I have been given a fair share of responsibility, more so than any of my prior roles. -->

**Tech:** JavaScript, ES6, [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org), [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org), TypeScript, VSCode, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Go, [Polymer Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester), Git, Swagger.

### Developer, [IG Index Ltd.](https://www.ig.com/uk) Cannon Bridge, London, UK - 09-2014â€“18/02/2016

#### JavaScript Developer

* *Price & Indicator Alerts:* My main responsibility was handling the UI aspectâ€”setting, configuring, triggeringâ€”of the various Alerts we support, from the basic Price Alert to Technical Indicators such as RSI and Moving Average. **Tech New:** Modern UI powered by ES2015 (Babel), Ember.js, Handlebars and Less. The UI was then composed of isolated and reusable Ember components. Runs on a NodeJS server, managed with npm and bower, and version controlled using Git. Integration and unit tests written in Mocha then run using Karma. **Tech Old:** Vanilla JavaScript using an in-house framework when changing the previous UI.
* *Charts:* Assisted in the conversion of the Adobe Flex Real Time Charts to an SVG-based version. **Tech:** d3 and tested like above.
* *Deeplinking:* A hashed action link, like typical deeplinks, that we send to our Clients which then launches the mobile IG app, or directs them to the app store for the device with the IG app pre-selected. Upon login the action is carried out automatically. I did the bulk of the work with the team lead overseeing it. **Tech:** Java 8, Spring and acceptance tested using Cucumber. Redirecting and launching of the IG app was done using vanilla JavaScript.

My primary responsibilities were to validate the end product against pre-defined requirements/workflows. 1. Worked on Thomson Reuters project UTAH as part of a large team. 2. Tasks included testing, observing, documenting software bugs, issues and errors before final release of Utah. 3. Testing was done over multiple iterations.

## Information

I am looking for a role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. Iâ€™ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current effortsâ€”all of which are equally interesting to me.

### Technology Stack

I'm flexible in terms of the choice of framework used, however, my ideal role will involve (any of) the following:

* Backend: Ideally Go/Golang as I have good experience with this.
* Frontend: JavaScript or any language that targets JavaScript on the frontend side, my ideal choice would be TypeScript. I would prefer to use Vue.js as the underlying framework that the UI is built with.
* Roles where Linux, Google Cloud Platform/Azure/AWS, Docker and Kubernetes are being used. Open Banking would be a plus.
* I'm up for learning more of Rust. It's just a hobby at the moment.

### Enumeration and Job Preferences

* **Rate:** Iâ€™m seeking a daily rate of >Â£580 per day. I'm willing to negotiate on this.
* **Location:** Iâ€™m looking for work in the UK, ideally in London as that is where I mainly live.
* **Start Date:** Iâ€™m available to start immediately.
* **Job Type:** I've a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I've been a contractor since then. I would prefer to stick to contracting but I will also consider a permanent position.
