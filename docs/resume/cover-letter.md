## Intro

I am a well-rounded Software Engineer, and I understand what it takes to release a product having worked on the back-end, front-end, testing and finally the deployment aspect of several products.

I am looking for a role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. I’ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current efforts—all of which are equally interesting to me.

## Background

A role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. I’ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current efforts—all of which are equally interesting to me.

I'm a well-rounded engineer and I'm able to see the delivery, from beginning to end, of a software stack. This includes the building, testing and continuous delivery of the solution. I have examples in my repos that demonstrate all these in a cloud environment:

* Go/Golang backends.
* Building frontends in JavaScript.
* Complete end-to-end testing of the final project.
* CI builds on the cloud.
* Deployment on the cloud using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Containerising software using Docker.
* Orchestrating the built containers using Kubernetes.

### Technology Stack

I'm flexible in terms of the choice of framework used, however, my ideal role will involve (any of) the following:

* Backend: Ideally Go/Golang as I have good experience with this.
* Frontend: JavaScript or any language that targets JavaScript on the frontend side, my ideal choice would be TypeScript. I would prefer to use Vue.js as the underlying framework that the UI is built with.
* Roles where Linux, Google Cloud Platform/Azure/AWS, Docker and Kubernetes are being used. Open Banking would be a plus.
* I'm up for learning more of Rust. It's just a hobby at the moment.

### Enumeration and Job Preferences

* **Rate:** I’m seeking a daily rate of >£580 per day. I'm willing to negotiate on this.
* **Location:** I’m looking for work in the UK, ideally in London as that is where I mainly live.
* **Start Date:** I’m available to start immediately.
* **Job Type:** I've a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I've been a contractor since then. I would prefer to stick to contracting but I will also consider a permanent position.

## Misc

I have a British passport but I mainly live in Marrakech, Morocco. I can come to London at most once every four weeks.

I am back in London until, hopefully, the 28nd of August at which point I will travel to Marrakech, Morocco for one week.

Kind regards,

Mohamed Bana
