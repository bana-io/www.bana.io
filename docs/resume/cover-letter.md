## Intro

I am a well-rounded Software Engineer, and I understand what it takes to release a product having worked on the back-end, front-end, testing and finally the deployment aspect of several products.

## Background

A role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. I’ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current efforts—all of which are equally interesting to me.

I'm a well-rounded engineer and I'm able to see the delivery, from beginning to end, of a software stack. This includes the building, testing and continuous delivery of the solution. I have examples in my repositories that demonstrate all these in a cloud environment:

* Go/Golang backends.
* Building frontends in JavaScript.
* Complete end-to-end testing of the final project.
* CI builds on the cloud.
* Deployment on the cloud using Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Containerising software using Docker.
* Orchestrating the built containers using Kubernetes.

## Job Preferences

### Salary and notice period

I'm willing to negotiate on this as it depends on a few things, that said:

* If it's a contracting role, minimum of £500 per day.
* If it's a permanent position, minimum of £90,000 per year.

I'm available to start after the **31/10/2021**, or possibly earlier.

### Work locations considered

Ideally, a remote role with an office in London.

If it's not fully remote, an office in East London, e.g., Canary Wharf, Aldgate (East), would be good.

### Key skills and preferred job role

I'm flexible in terms of the choice of framework used, however, my ideal role will involve (any of) the following:

* Backend: Ideally Go/Golang as I have good experience with this.
* Frontend: JavaScript or any language that targets JavaScript on the frontend side, my ideal choice would be TypeScript. I would prefer to use Vue.js as the underlying framework that the UI is built with.
* Roles where Linux, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)/Azure/AWS, Docker and Kubernetes are being used. Open Banking would be a plus.
* I'm up for learning more of Rust. It's just a hobby at the moment.

**Summary:** (Full Stack) Senior Software Engineer: Golang, Vue.js, Linux, Docker, Docker-Compose, Kubernetes, Cloud Computing, Google Cloud Computing (GCP).

### Any visa restrictions – if applicable (ILR, Tier 2, Dependant visa etc)

* **Passport/Nationality:** I have a British Passport, National Insurance number, British Citizenship etc.
* **Drivers Licence:** Full UK Driving Licence.

<!-- * **Background/Criminal Check:**
  * [Police Certificates - ACRO Criminal Records Office](https://www.acro.police.uk/police_certificates.aspx): Certificate was issued in 08/03/2021.

     > **Summary of convictions and reprimands/warnings/cautions/impending prosecutions/under investigations held on UK police databases and disclosed in accordance with the ACRO stepdown model:**
     >
     > NO TRACE. -->

### Reason for looking for new role

My employment at Paymentsense Limited will finish on the 31/10/2021.
