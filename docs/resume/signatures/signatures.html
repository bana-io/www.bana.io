<p>Most of what I said below is up for discussion.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate:</strong> I’m seeking a daily rate of &gt;£580 per day, if it&#39;s a contracting role. If it&#39;s a permanent role, I&#39;d be looking for &gt;£90k per year. I&#39;m willing to negotiate on this.</li>
<li><strong>Start Date:</strong> I’m available to start immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Job Type:</strong> I&#39;ve a limited company called BANAIO LTD which I started in March 2017 and I&#39;ve been a contractor since then. I would prefer to stick to contracting but I will also consider a permanent position.</li>
<li><p><strong>Location:</strong> If it&#39;s a remote role, the office should be based in London in the event that I need to go there. If it&#39;s a permanent role, it definitely needs to be in London. I have a British passport and I live between London and Marrakech, Morocco. I&#39;m ideally looking for remote work be in contract or permanent. My preferences are below. <strong><em>I prefer option 1</em></strong> but we can talk more about this. The biggest issue will be the cost of the flights that&#39;s why I&#39;d prefer option one. Basically, my fiancee (soon to be wife) lives in Marrakech, Morocco and I&#39;d like to spend as much time with her as possible. I own a flat in Marrakech and I&#39;ve got my computer equipment there already setup and running, and I&#39;ve got 200Mb fibre optic connection, so working and communication shouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Eight (8) weeks in Marrakech then one (1) week or two (2) weeks in London.</li>
<li>Four (4) weeks in Marrakech then one (1) week in London.</li>
<li>Three (3) weeks in Marrakech then one week (1) in London.</li>
<li>One (1) month in Marrakech then one (1) month in London.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Is this fully remote?</li>
<li>What is the pay?</li>
<li>Is it a contracting role or a permanent one? I don&#39;t mind so much as long as it is a remote role.</li>
</ol>
