# Recommendations

1. Person_x has been an amazing talent to work with and I would highly recommend him. He has helped lead various teams focused on upstream open-source contributions in various languages - Go, Python, Java, etc. He also worked with me on various Kubernetes and Cloud Native related projects and technology. He's a strong, senior engineer; it's always great to work with Person_x. If you have a chance to engage him I highly recommend it. I would hire Person_x again in the future and look forward to maintaining a relationship with him throughout my life.
