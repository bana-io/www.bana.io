\subsection[title={Objectives},reference={objectives}]

Please, {\em {\em ONLY}} contact me about remote roles that meet these
conditions:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Golang/Go roles.
\item
  Vue.js roles.
\item
  Roles where Linux, Google Cloud Platform or Azure, Docker and Open
  Banking are being used.
\item
  I am up for learning more of Rust. It's just a hobby at the moment.
\stopitemize

I kindly request that you respect my requests and do not spam me about
roles that don't fit these criteria.

My main interests are in Rust, Golang/Go and Vue.js.

I am a well-rounded Software Engineer, and I understand what it takes to
release a product having worked on the back-end, front-end, testing and
finally the deployment aspect of several products.

I am looking for a role involving web technologies hosted on a
cloud-based backend. I've worked on all the tiers of a software product,
so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I
feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large
selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform
support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and
big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current efforts---all of
which are equally interesting to me.

Worked at startup specialising in software that runs on ship on two
projects that were heavily Go-based.

{\bf \type{platform-document-storage-service}}: Document storage and
retrieval to be used by others services, so it's a core service. The
core of the service was written in Go and exposed using
\useURL[url18][https://grpc.io/][][gRPC]\from[url18] and http using
\useURL[url19][https://github.com/gorilla/mux][][go
gorilla/mux]\from[url19]. Both write and retrieve supported arbitrarily
large files which was achieved using gRPC unidirectional streams. The
underlying store was MongoDB's
\useURL[url20][https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/gridfs/][][GridsFS]\from[url20]
which I interfaced with using the Go driver
\useURL[url21][https://gopkg.in/mgo.v2][][mgo]\from[url21].

{\bf \type{auditing}}: Currently working on this. The service is
structured very similar to the preceding in that the underlying service
is exposed using gRPC but the top-level interface is done using
\useURL[url22][graphql.org][][GraphQL]\from[url22]. I wrote the GraphQL
server in go using
\useURL[url23][https://github.com/graph-gophers/graphql-go][][graphql-go]\from[url23].
The underlying store is in Postgres and the library I used to interact
with it is \useURL[url24][http://gorm.io/][][GORM]\from[url24].

{\bf Tech:} Go, Golang, gRPC, Protocol Buffers, MongoDB, GraphQL, go

Did a fair amount of architectural UI work:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  JWT-based authentication: Implemented most, if not all, of the
  authentication related UI features. Polymer didn't have an
  authentication module as it's fairly new requiring me to reimplement
  this feature.
\item
  API interactions: I introduced Swagger JS and did the conversion from
  plain XHR to Promises, and ensured API was in-sync with the state of
  the authentication.
\item
  Updates via the Web Socket for notifications and async task updates:
  STOMP Over WebSocket.
\item
  Bootstrapped the testing using Web Component Tester.
\item
  Deciding on the build, test and hosting strategy, e.g., hosting our
  own CDN using Azure.
\item
  Performance: 1) pushed to have HTTP/2 enabled, and prototyped, on our
  custom server written in Go, 2) implemented lazy-loading of our Web
  Components which are included using HTML Imports, 3) Significantly
  improved UI build scripts; went from a somewhat un-deterministic build
  to one that almost always runs.
\item
  Introduced ES6 to the code-base, and moving to defining Polymer
  elements using ES6 classes.
\item
  Misc: libraries/utils to ease UI development.
\stopitemize

We deploy Docker images to our Kubernetes cluster running in Azure
using:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  Docker: Fairly comfortable using this.
\item
  Kubernetes: I've done deployments of dev branches, so I understand the
  deployment model, navigating the Kubernetes dashboard and crude
  command line interactions, e.g., port-forwarding of the service the
  pod is running from the cluster to the local machine.
\stopitemize

I'm finishing up on adding support for our language Antha to Monaco
Editor, the editor that powers Visual Studio Code.

Since this is a startup I have done a fair amount of work and I have
been given a fair share of responsibility, more so than any of my prior
roles.

{\bf Tech:} JavaScript, ES6, Polymer, Web Components, TypeScript,
VSCode, Azure, Docker, Kubernetes, Go, Web Component Tester, Git,
Swagger.

\subsubsubsection[title={JavaScript
Developer},reference={javascript-developer}]

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  {\em Price & Indicator Alerts:} My main responsibility was handling
  the UI aspect---setting, configuring, triggering---of the various
  Alerts we support, from the basic Price Alert to Technical Indicators
  such as RSI and Moving Average. Tech New: Modern UI powered by ES2015
  (Babel), Ember.js, Handlebars and Less. The UI was then composed of
  isolated and reusable Ember components. Runs on a NodeJS server,
  managed with npm and bower, and version controlled using Git.
  Integration and unit tests written in Mocha then run using Karma.
  {\bf Tech Old:} Vanilla JavaScript using an in-house framework when
  changing the previous UI.
\item
  {\em Charts:} Assisted in the conversion of the Adobe Flex Real Time
  Charts to an SVG-based version. {\bf Tech:} d3 and tested like above.
\item
  {\em Deeplinking:} A hashed action link, like typical deeplinks, that
  we send to our Clients which then launches the mobile IG app, or
  directs them to the app store for the device with the IG app
  pre-selected. Upon login the action is carried out automatically. I
  did the bulk of the work with the team lead overseeing it. {\bf Tech:}
  Java 8, Spring and acceptance tested using Cucumber. Redirecting and
  launching of the IG app was done using vanilla JavaScript.
\stopitemize

Due to the nature of the work, I cannot disclose too much detail.

\subsubsubsection[title={JavaScript (UI) Developer,
01/2014--09/2014},reference={javascript-ui-developer-012014092014}]

UI for the next generation of the product which is built around, loosely
speaking, a real-time distributed analytics store. The aim is for the
old system to stream data to the new system so we can provide all the
great visualizations available in the HTML ecosystem, which was not
achievable in a reasonable amount of time in Swing.

The code is entirely modularized using RequireJS so we can test each
viewmodel without creating a view, we then test the entire UI
(end-to-end tests) using WebDriverJS.

Some Java/C coding required to write NodeJS bindings to interact with
the store. We evaluated several frameworks, Angular, Batman and
KnockoutJS, by writing prototype applications that connected to our
backend for a period of roughly 4-6 months before we chose to settle on
Knockout.js.

{\bf Tech:} JavaScript, NodeJS, Node-WebKit, Durandal, KnockoutJS,
RequireJS, Git, Jasmine, Protractor (WebDriverJS), Jenkins, Bower,
HTML5, CSS, LoopBack.io.

\subsubsubsection[title={Java (UI) Developer -
07/2012--12/2013},reference={java-ui-developer---072012122013}]

Worked with two developers and one QA member on a new Swing UI, ACLite,
that uses our new streaming-based API to access Geneos data, for more
info. see
\useURL[url35][https://resources.itrsgroup.com/OpenAccess]\from[url35].
We access data from a fault-tolerant Cluster that is built on a set of
distributed nodes. The system we coded against is somewhat similar to
the Amazon distributed key/value store, DynamoDB, except with support
for streaming, so I am familiar with dealing with distributed systems.

{\bf Tech:} Java, Maven, Swing, Eclipse, Jenkins, Git, Vagrant.

\subsubsubsection[title={C++ Developer -
02/2010--06/2012},reference={c-developer---022010062012}]

Spent one year with Run The Business (RTB) team, a team set-up to fix
critical bugs that Customers encounter. A very challenging role which
requires all-around product knowledge, good debugging skills and being
able to liaise with our Support staff in dealing with the Customers.
Prior to this I was one of three developers working in the Transactions
and Latency Monitoring team (part of the backend team) doing core C++.
We wrote and maintained the following plug-ins that are part of the
Geneos suite:

\startitemize[n,packed][stopper=.]
\item
  FIX-Analyser: Monitors FIX (protocol) messages.
\item
  Feed Latency Monitor: Monitors feeds and calculates latency of
  instruments and fields across the monitored feeds.
\item
  Message Tracker: Tracks, generally, FIX messages across several
  checkpoints.
\item
  Market Data Reliability: See below. And bespoke plug-ins written for
  specific firms.
\stopitemize

We also maintained several non-finance specific plug-ins. I ported
another bespoke plug-in called Price Latency Monitor (provides latency
figures for bonds) to MS VC++ when I worked on this team. Projects:

\startitemize[packed]
\item
  I converted the Windows version of the entire product suite from
  Visual Studio 2005 to 2010.
\item
  I wrote the Market Data Reliability plug-in. This plug-in connects to
  the Patsystem's Trading API (www.patsystems.com) to monitor commodity
  prices, using their C API, to determine if prices are \quote{stale}.
\item
  I ported a significant part of our product to Solaris x86-64 (64-bit
  non-sparc architecture).
\stopitemize

{\bf Tech:} C++, STL, Boost, Visual Studio, Linux/Unix, GDB, DBX, Make,
Configure, XML, XPath, CPPUnit.

Thomson Reuters project UTAH as part of a large team. 2. Tasks included
testing, observing, documenting software bugs, issues and errors before
final release of Utah. 3. Testing was done over multiple iterations.
