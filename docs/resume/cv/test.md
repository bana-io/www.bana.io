## Objectives

Please, *_ONLY_* contact me about remote roles that meet these conditions:

* Golang/Go roles.
* Vue.js roles.
* Roles where Linux, Google Cloud Platform or Azure, Docker and Open Banking are being used.
* I am up for learning more of Rust. It's just a hobby at the moment.

I kindly request that you respect my requests and do not spam me about roles that don't fit these criteria.

My main interests are in Rust, Golang/Go and Vue.js.

I am a well-rounded Software Engineer, and I understand what it takes to release a product having worked on the back-end, front-end, testing and finally the deployment aspect of several products.

I am looking for a role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. Iâ€™ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current effortsâ€”all of which are equally interesting to me.
