A role involving web technologies hosted on a cloud-based backend. I’ve worked on all the tiers of a software product, so I can appreciate the different concerns expressed at each level. I feel the latest trend in web technologies; quick prototyping, large selection of libraries, ease of programming and its cross-platform support is where the future is heading. This, distributed systems and big data algorithms are where I am focusing my current efforts—all of which are equally interesting to me.

I'm flexible in terms of the choice of framework used, however, my ideal role will involve any of the following:

* JavaScript or any language that targets JavaScript on the frontend side. My ideal choice would be TypeScript. Vue.js, React or Polymer as the underlying framework the UI is built with.
* Go or JavaScript on the backend as I have experience with these languages.

I'm a well-rounded engineer and I'm able to see the delivery, from beginning to end, of a software stack. This includes the building, testing and continuous delivery of the solution. I have examples in my repos that demonstrate all these in a cloud environment:

* Building JavaScript frontends.
* Complete end-to-end testing of the final project.
* Go backends.
* Cloud-based CI builds.

Worthy of note:

* Deployment to Azure and Google Cloud.
* Live running software on Azure and Google Cloud.

Enumeration and preferences:

* **Rate:** I’m seeking a daily rate of >£580 p/d.
* **Location:** I am looking for work in the Middle East, preferably in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.

Regards,
Bana
